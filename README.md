# od-faucet
Version: v0.0.1


Create an open-source faucet service offering small amounts of digital tokens for testing purposes on the BSV Blockchain. This service aids developers and testers in their work without requiring them to acquire real digital currencies. It's applicable to non-production environments such as testnet.

A testnet faucet provides users with free testnet tokens for testing and development. This allows developers to test their applications and smart contracts before deploying them to the main network.
